The CRUX compiler takes in .CRX files and outputs .ASM files for MIPS processing. 

While not all MIPS processors support the CRUX specifications QTSPIM at http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/ does support all assembly instructions generated by the CRUX compiler.

Please review CRUX Specification Sheet for grammar structture and design.
