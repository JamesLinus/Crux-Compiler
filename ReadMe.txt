Crux compiler outputs .ASM files for MIPS processing. 

While not all MIPS processors support the CRUX specifications:
	QTSPIM at http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/ supports all assembly instructions generated by the crux compiler.

Please review Crux Specification Sheet for language grammar and design.
